# Simple JavaScript Games

This repository contains a collection of simple games built using JavaScript. The games include a memory game, a matching game, and a tic-tac-toe game.

## Getting Started

To play the games, simply clone or download the repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser. The games can be accessed through the navigation menu at the top of the page.

## Features

- The memory game challenges players to find pairs of matching cards.
- The matching game challenges players to find and connect matching pairs of shapes.
- The tic-tac-toe game allows players to play against each other or against an AI opponent.
- The games include a reset button to start a new game and a score tracker to keep track of wins and losses.

## Future Plans

In the future, I plan to add additional games to the collection such as:

- A puzzle game where players slide pieces to form an image.
- A guessing game where players have to guess a word based on clues.
- A card game where players have to build the highest-scoring hand.

## Credits

This project was created by [AmpasTheodoros](https://github.com/AmpasTheodoros) as a way to learn and practice JavaScript. The images used in the games were sourced from [OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org/).
